# Discord Tic Tac Toe Bot

This is a simple discord bot created to play tic tac toe with an other player on a discord server.

## Usage

    git clone https://github.com/Antoine-Meloche/Discord-Tic-Tac-Toe.git
    cd Discord-Tic-Tac-Toe
    pip install discord
    mv token.example token.txt
    echo "<BOT_TOKEN>" > token.txt
    python tic-tac-toe.py

To get the <BOT_TOKEN> needed for the operation of the discord bot program, you will have to create a bot application from https://discord.com/developpers/applications and find it's token in the Bot tab of the application.
